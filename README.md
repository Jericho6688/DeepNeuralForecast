# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Model using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project leverages deep learning techniques to develop a cryptocurrency price prediction model.  It aims to provide data-driven insights for trading decisions and explore the potential of deep learning in financial markets.

## Methodology

The model is built by:

1.  **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Gathering historical data on cryptocurrency prices, trading volumes, market sentiment, and other relevant factors.
2.  **Model Training:** Employing a combination of machine learning models, including:
    *   Multi-layered Neural Networks (e.g., LSTMs)
    *   Logistic Regression
    *   Random Forests
    *   XGBoost

    This approach allows the model to capture both temporal and non-linear characteristics present in cryptocurrency price movements.

## Objectives

*   Improve the prediction accuracy of future cryptocurrency price fluctuations.
*   Provide data support for informed cryptocurrency trading decisions.
*   Explore the applicability and potential of deep learning techniques within financial markets.

## Technologies Used

*   TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

## Data Sources

*   CryptoCompare API, CoinMarketCap API, yahoo finance API (for sentiment analysis)
